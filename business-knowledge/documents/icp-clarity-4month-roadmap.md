## PHASE 3: SCALING & CLOSING TO GOAL (Week 13-17 | Feb 3-Mar 2)

### Week 13-14: Tier 2 Launch + Pipeline Acceleration

**Objective:** Land second Tier 1 client (if not already), convert first client to Tier 2, expand outreach to 20+/day.

**3-hour/day breakdown:**
- 45 min: Tier 2 delivery kickoff with first client
- 60 min: Close 1-2 more Tier 1 clients (proposals → conversations → signatures)
- 45 min: LinkedIn outreach (20+/day, focus on hottest-responding geographies)
- 30 min: Landing page finalization + CMS updates

**Timeline Note:**
- If your first client signs Tier 2 week 13, you have 4-6 weeks for delivery = completes by mid-March
- This is running in parallel with Tier 1 pipeline closing

**Tier 2 Scope (to run while doing outreach):**
- Week 1 (your time): 2 kickoff calls + system design
- Week 2-3 (you + client): Tool setup, data mapping, some automation
- Week 4-5 (your time): Testing, optimization, documentation
- Week 6 (you + client): Final debrief + Tier 3 retainer conversation

**This is higher leverage because:**
- Tier 2 = 15-18K SEK (vs. Tier 1 = 5-8K)
- Tier 2 leads to Tier 3 retainer (3-5K/month ongoing)
- Tier 2 is more complex → harder for competitors to replicate → better for case studies

**Deliverables:**
1. **Landing Page Live** (Tier 1 focused, Tier 2-3 secondary CTAs)
   - URL: yourdomain.com or landing page platform
   - Three sections: Tier 1 audit | Tier 2 infrastructure | Tier 3 retainer
   - CTA: Book discovery call (Calendly link)
   - Email list signup: "Get ICP audit tips" → nurture via email

2. **Tier 1 Client Pipeline Dashboard**
   - In current pipeline: ___ (names, stage, expected close date)
   - Likely to close by Feb 15: ___ (2 clients would hit 15K SEK)
   - Likely to close by Mar 10: ___ (1 more client would hit 30K SEK)
   - Value at risk / upside potential

3. **Outreach Performance Dashboard**
   - Contacts sent (by country): Sweden __, Denmark __, Norway __, Germany __
   - Response rate (by country): __%, __%, __%, __%
   - Conversion rate (contacts → calls booked): __% (target: >10%)
   - Calls booked (by country): __ | By week: __
   - Days from contact to first call (average): __ days

**Success Metrics:**
- Landing page live and getting traffic
- 20+ Tier 1 prospects in active conversation
- 1 Tier 2 project launched (in delivery)
- 2 confirmed Tier 1 closes (15K SEK achieved = 50% of goal)

---

### Week 15-16: Final Push to 30K Goal

- Option B: 1 existing Tier 1 client commits to full Tier 2 (15-18K, recognizes as March revenue)
- Option C: 2 more Tier 1 clients (15K total)

**Email Sequence for Warm Leads (Week 15):**

**Deliverables:**
1. **Closed Deals Summary**
   - Tier 1 Client #1: [Company] | [Date signed] | 7,500 SEK
   - Tier 1 Client #2: [Company] | [Date signed] | 7,500 SEK
   - Tier 1 Client #3 (if applies): [Company] | [Date signed] | Amount

## KEY METRICS TO MONITOR WEEKLY

**Leading Indicators (predict closures):**
- LinkedIn contacts sent (target: 70-100/week)
- Response rate (target: >15% once messaging refined)
- Calls booked (target: 8-12/week)
- Proposal conversion (target: 40%+ of proposals → closes)

**Lagging Indicators (measure results):**
- Revenue closed (target: 7,500-15,000 SEK/week in weeks 13+)
- Tier 1 closes (target: 1 per week weeks 11-17)
- Tier 2 in delivery (target: 1+ by week 13)
- Case studies documented (target: 2-3 by end of March)

**Efficiency Metrics (measure effort):**
- Time per activity (LinkedIn outreach, calls, delivery, tracking)
- Cost per acquisition = (3 hours/day × hourly rate) ÷ # closed deals
- Days from contact to close (target: <30 days for Tier 1)

---

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Consistency over perfection**
   - Send 10+ LinkedIn messages/day even if not perfectly personalized
   - Better to have 70 mediocre conversations than 10 perfect ones
   - Refine based on response data, not theory

2. **Tier 1 as funnel entry**
   - Every Tier 1 client should have Tier 2 conversation by end of delivery
   - Tier 1 = relationship builder + Tier 2 = revenue multiplier
   - Don't let Tier 1 clients go silent after delivery

3. **Case study is your marketing**
   - Document every close with permission to use
   - Case study = proof that unlocks bigger deals
   - By week 10, you should have 1 usable case study

4. **Geographic focus prevents dilution**
   - Start Sweden-only weeks 5-8
   - Add Denmark/Norway week 9
   - Only test Germany/others week 13+
   - Spreading thin across 4 countries too early = no traction anywhere

5. **Message refinement happens weekly**
   - Track which message got 25%+ response rate
   - Use that version for next 50 contacts
   - Track which signal gets fastest calls (e.g., "recent hiring" vs. "tech migration")
   - Double down on what works

6. **Landing page is secondary**
   - Don't wait for perfect landing page to start outreach
   - LinkedIn + email drives deals, not landing page
   - Landing page becomes useful weeks 13+ (warm leads → cold leads)

7. **Tier 2 + Tier 3 are multipliers**
   - If you close 3 Tier 1 clients at 7,500 SEK = 22,500 (near goal)
   - If you convert 1 Tier 1 to Tier 2 at 15,000 = 15,000 + 7,500 × 2 = 30,000
   - Better to convert 1 client to all 3 tiers than close 5 Tier 1 clients

---

## REALITY CHECK: 3 HOURS/DAY ALLOCATION

**Ideal allocation (225 min/week = ~45 min/day):**

- 45 min: LinkedIn outreach + follow-ups (M-F) = 45 min × 5 = 225 min/week
- 45 min: Calls (discovery, proposal, delivery) (2-3 calls × 15-20 min) = 90 min/week
- 45 min: Content creation + posts = 45 min/week
- 45 min: Tracking + analysis + adjustments = 45 min/week
- 30 min: Proposal writing + delivery preparation = 30 min/week
- **Total: ~15 hours/week (3 hours/day)**

**In reality, some days will be heavier:**
- Call-heavy days: 60-90 min on calls + 60 min prep = 120+ min (2+ hours)
- Outreach days: 90 min contacts + 30 min tracking = 120 min
- Delivery days: 120 min active work + 30 min admin = 150 min

**Flexibility built in:**
- Week 5-6: Heavier on outreach (70% outreach, 20% content, 10% calls)
- Week 9-12: Balanced (40% outreach, 20% content, 30% calls/delivery, 10% tracking)
- Week 15-17: Heavier on closes (30% outreach, 10% content, 40% calls/delivery, 20% tracking)

---

## RED FLAGS & WHAT TO ADJUST

| Flag | Action |
|------|--------|
| <10% response rate on LinkedIn messages | A/B test new message; use more specific signal-based hooks |
| <25% call-to-proposal conversion | Adjust discovery call script; be more direct about Tier 1 offer |
| <40% proposal-to-close conversion | Reduce proposal complexity; lower Tier 1 price; shorten timeline |
| No Tier 2 conversations after 2 weeks Tier 1 delivery | Proactively introduce Tier 2 in debrief call (week 2, not week 4) |
| Only 1 geography working (e.g., only Sweden) | Stay focused on Sweden; don't dilute to other countries until Feb 13 |
| Cases studies taking >2 weeks to get permission | Move testimonial request to end of debrief call (when they're happiest) |
| 3 hours/day is unsustainable | Drop content creation to 1x/week; focus on outreach + calls only |

## SUMMARY: 30,000 SEK MARCH GOAL

**Revenue equation:**
- 2 × Tier 1 (7,500 SEK each) = 15,000 SEK
- 1 × Tier 2 (15,000 SEK) = 15,000 SEK
- **Total: 30,000 SEK**

OR

- 3 × Tier 1 (7,500 SEK each) = 22,500 SEK
- 1 × Tier 1 upsell to Tier 2 mini (7,500 SEK) = 7,500 SEK
- **Total: 30,000 SEK**

**Timeline to close:**
- First Tier 1: Week 8 (by end of January)
- Second Tier 1: Week 12 (by early February)
- Third Tier 1 OR first Tier 2: Week 16 (by mid-March)

**Confidence level:** High
- Model is based on realistic conversion rates (10-15% contact to call, 25-40% call to close)
- Assumes 100+ quality contacts per month
- Accounts for geographic variance
- Builds in case study momentum effect

**If you fall behind:**
- Increase daily LinkedIn outreach to 15-20/day (weeks 13-17)
- Reduce Tier 1 price by 1,000 SEK if needed (still 6,500)
- Push harder on Tier 2 conversion (1 Tier 2 = 1.5 Tier 1 deals)
- Extend into Germany/Netherlands earlier if Nordic plateau
